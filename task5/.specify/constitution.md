TaskManager Constitution
=======================

Last Updated: 2025-11-20

Purpose
-------
TaskManager exists to provide a robust, collaborative system for managing assignments and tasks in academic or project settings. This constitution defines TaskManager’s mission, membership, governance, decision-making, amendments, and code of conduct.

1. Mission
----------
- Enable clear, organized tracking of assignments and tasks.
- Support collaboration among users and contributors.
- Maintain a simple, transparent governance model for ongoing improvements.

2. Definitions
--------------
- "User": anyone who uses TaskManager to manage assignments.
- "Contributor": anyone who submits code, documentation, or feedback.
- "Maintainer": trusted contributors who review, merge, and release changes, and resolve issues.
- "Proposal": a written suggestion for changes to features, processes, or governance.
- "Quorum": the minimum number of votes or participants required to validate a decision (see Voting).

3. Membership
-------------
- Anyone may use TaskManager and propose changes.
- Contributors are recognized by submitting code, documentation, or feedback.
- Maintainers are appointed by consensus of active contributors and are responsible for project health.

4. Roles and Responsibilities
----------------------------
- Users: manage assignments, report bugs, suggest improvements.
- Contributors: submit code, documentation, or feature requests.
- Maintainers: review and merge contributions, coordinate releases, resolve conflicts, and enforce the code of conduct.

5. Decision-Making
------------------
- Routine changes (bug fixes, minor features) are made by maintainers or contributors with review.
- Major changes (new features, governance, or policy) follow this process:
  1. Proposal submission: any contributor may submit a written proposal.
  2. Discussion period: minimum 7 days for public feedback.
  3. Decision: if no major objections, maintainers may approve by simple majority. If objections remain, a vote is held among active contributors.

Voting rules
- Eligibility: voting is open to active contributors and maintainers.
- Quorum: for governance or constitutional changes, quorum is 25% of active contributors or 3 people, whichever is greater.
- Passing threshold: constitutional amendments require two-thirds majority; routine proposals require simple majority.

6. Conflict Resolution
----------------------
- Disputes should be resolved through discussion and compromise.
- If unresolved, maintainers may mediate or appoint a neutral panel.
- All decisions should be documented with rationale.

7. Code of Conduct
------------------
All participants must treat each other respectfully. Harassment, hate speech, and abusive behavior are not tolerated. Violations may result in warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal, as determined by maintainers.

8. Amendments
-------------
- Any contributor may propose amendments using the proposal process.
- Amendments require public posting, at least 14 days of discussion, and approval by two-thirds majority with quorum.
- Emergency amendments may be made by maintainers for urgent needs but must be ratified at the next regular vote.

9. Records and Transparency
---------------------------
- Key decisions, contributor lists, and governance actions should be recorded in the project repository or a public location.
- Maintainers will publish an annual summary of major changes and governance actions.

10. Dissolution
---------------
- If TaskManager is discontinued, assets and intellectual property will be handled according to contributor agreements. Otherwise, maintainers will propose a distribution plan and contributors will vote.

11. Adoption
------------
- This constitution is effective when adopted by the founding maintainers and published in the project repository.
